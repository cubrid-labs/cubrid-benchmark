# Benchmark Runbook

This runbook is the operator checklist for producing benchmark evidence that is comparable,
reviewable, and suitable for filing against driver or ORM repositories.

## Before You Run

1. Confirm you are on the intended branch and have a clean working tree for the benchmark session.
2. Confirm the host belongs to the same `comparable_group` as the baseline you want to compare.
3. Use the repository-standard DB stack from `docker/compose.yml`:
   - CUBRID `11.2` on port `33000`
   - MySQL `8.0` on port `3306`
4. Keep the machine on AC power.
5. Stop editors, browsers, package managers, and unrelated containers that can perturb CPU or I/O.
6. Apply schema and deterministic seed before collecting reportable measurements.

Standard setup:

```bash
make up
make seed
```

## Tier 0 Procedure

Purpose: validate that both DBs and all language harnesses are healthy before collecting
performance evidence.

Run:

```bash
make tier0
make tier0-ts
make tier0-go
```

Acceptance criteria:

- Both databases accept connections
- CRUD smoke tests pass in Python, TypeScript, and Go
- No container restarts or health-check flaps occur during the gate

If Tier 0 fails, stop. Do not treat any later measurements as valid until readiness is restored.

## Tier 1 Procedure

Purpose: measure raw driver throughput for the core sequential workloads.

### Standard run

```bash
make tier1-python
make tier1-ts
make tier1-go
```

### Reproducibility control run

Run the local control target before filing a regression or improvement claim:

```bash
make bench-verify
```

`bench-verify` executes the Python Tier 1 command twice and fails if any benchmark drifts outside
the repository noise band for back-to-back control runs.

### Evidence handling

For a reportable Tier 1 session:

1. Create or select the correct experiment folder
2. Create a new immutable `runs/YYYY-MM-DD_label/` folder
3. Record host/software/driver metadata in `run.yaml`
4. Copy raw outputs into `raw/`
5. Update the experiment README with the new run and conclusion

## Tier 2 Procedure

Purpose: measure ORM overhead relative to the raw driver path.

Run the Tier 2 benchmark for the language under study after Tier 0 passes and after the same DB
stack is freshly seeded.

Expected operator flow:

1. Run Tier 0 validation first
2. Re-seed if the ORM workload mutates benchmark tables materially
3. Execute the Tier 2 language target
4. Preserve raw output and derived summaries in the experiment run folder
5. Compare ORM results against the matching raw-driver baseline from the same comparable group

Tier 2 conclusions must describe the ratio versus the raw driver, not only absolute throughput.

## Reproducibility Controls

### CPU governor and power management

- Linux hosts should use the `performance` governor when possible
- If `performance` is unavailable, record the active governor in run notes
- Disable laptop battery saver / vendor power-saving profiles
- Avoid thermal throttling: let the machine cool down before back-to-back replications if needed

### Network isolation

- Run benchmarks on a stable local network with no VPN reconnects during measurement
- Do not run heavy downloads, package installs, or remote sync jobs during a benchmark session
- Prefer localhost-only DB traffic; do not move DB containers to shared remote hosts for a run that
  will be compared to local baselines

### Version pinning strategy

Pin and record these versions for every reportable run:

- DB images: `cubrid/cubrid:11.2`, `mysql:8.0`
- Docker / Docker Compose version
- Python / Go / Node.js runtime versions
- Driver and ORM versions under test
- Benchmark command variant used

If any pinned component changes, assume the old baseline is no longer directly comparable until a
new baseline is recorded.

### Significant-difference threshold

Use the following interpretation inside one comparable group:

- `≤5%` relative delta: equivalent/noise band
- `>5%` and `<10%`: suspicious, requires more replication
- `≥10%` relative delta: significant effect-size threshold for opening a performance issue,
  provided replication and provenance requirements are met

## Environment Validation Checklist

Before accepting a run as evidence, confirm all items below:

- [ ] `make up` completed without container restart loops
- [ ] `make seed` completed against the expected schema
- [ ] Tier 0 passed for Python, TypeScript, and Go
- [ ] Host was on AC power and not in a power-saving profile
- [ ] CPU governor was `performance` or recorded explicitly in notes
- [ ] No unrelated heavy containers or background jobs were running
- [ ] DB image versions matched the intended baseline
- [ ] Driver/runtime versions were captured in `run.yaml`
- [ ] A new immutable run folder was created under `experiments/**/runs/**`
- [ ] Raw outputs were stored under `raw/`
- [ ] The run references the correct `comparable_group`

## Filing Quality Bar

Open a performance issue only when all of the following are true:

1. Minimum replications:
   - exploratory note: `2` full replications
   - issue-worthy claim: `3` full replications
2. Confidence bar:
   - the direction of change is consistent across replications
   - the observed effect remains outside the `±5%` noise band
   - claims at or above `10%` relative delta are preferred for filing
3. Provenance in the issue body:
   - experiment slug
   - baseline run ID
   - candidate run ID(s)
   - `comparable_group`
   - exact commands used
   - links or paths to raw artifacts and report summary

Issue bodies should state whether the result is a driver-throughput regression, ORM-overhead
regression, or an improvement validated by before/after evidence.
